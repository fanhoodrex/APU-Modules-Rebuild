         The Eiffel Tower can be found almost anywhere in Paris, as long as you can look up. It actually contains a very romantic love story - no matter where, whenever you want to look back, I have been waiting. At that time the Eiffel Tower was the tallest building in the world. It took Eiffel ten years to build, only to express the love for his wife at the height closest to heaven at the time.

         If you are lucky enough to stay in Paris when you are young, then for the rest of your life, wherever you go, Paris will always be with you because it is a flowing feast. Most of Paris's famous sights are located on both sides of the Seine, so the hotel can be located along the banks of the Seine, as all the sights are almost within walking distance. In addition, choosing a hotel in the city center can also guarantee travel safety, as there are too many pickpockets in the Paris metro.
